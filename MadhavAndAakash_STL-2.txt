Pair:

It is also a template class of STL.

but it is not a container.

Syntax:

pair <int, string> p1;
pair <string, string> p2;
pair <string, float> p3;

Tuple:

Just like in pair, we can pair two heterogeneuos objects, in tuple we can pair multiple objects.

Syntax:

tuple <T1, T2, T3> tuple1;

Example:

tuple <string, int, int> t1;


Relational Operators: Work with pair, tuple and vector as well.

==
!=
>
<
>=
<=


Vector in STL:

The most general purpose container is the vector.

It supports a Dynamic Array.

Vector provide memory flexibility.

vector size:

Vector being a dynamic array doesn't needs size during execution.

Syntax:

vector <int> v1; //declaration with 0 capacity

Access values from the vector:

1. subscript operator : []

2. at()

Member functions of vector:

-->push_back():

it is used to add value at the end of the vector.

-->pop_back():

It is used to remove last element/value from the vector.


capacity():

return capacity of the vector.

size():

It returns the number of elements currently in the vector.

clear():

removes all the elements from the vector.

front() and back(): Same as array class template
