Static Members in C++:

1. static local variable
2. static member variables
3. static member functions

-->Static Local Variable

concepts as it is taken from C.
They are by default initialized to zero.
Their lifetime is throughout the program.

-->Static Member Variable

Declared inside the class.
Also known as class member variable.
They must be defined outside the class.
Static member variable does not belong to any object, but to the whole class.
There will be only one copy of static member variable for the whole class.
Any object can use the same copy of class variable.
They can also be used with class name.

-->Static Member Functions

They are qualified with the keyword static.
They are also called class member functions.
They can be invoked/called with or without object.
They can only access static members of the class.

#Friend Function:

friend function is not a member function of a class to which it is a friend.
friend function is declared in the class with friend keyword.
It must be defined outside the class to which it is friend.
Friend function can access any member of the class to which it is a friend.
Friend function can't access members of the class directly.
It has no caller object.
It should not be defined with membership label.
